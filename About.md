##LEGO Set Lookup Tool
  
This Shiny App is for searching and viewin LEGO Set information from the years 1950 to 2016.
The dataset is from [Rebrickable.com](http://rebrickable.com/) that contains the basic information of each set (set id, year, number of pieces, theme, set name).  

Data Source: http://rebrickable.com/downloads  
**Note**: I didn't use the API to collect data, the data is only accurate through 4/24/2016.
